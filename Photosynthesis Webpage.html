    <p> <b> Photosynthesis </b> is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that,
        through cellular respiration, can later be released to fuel the organism's activities. Some of this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules,
        such as sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water. Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. 
        Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, 
        and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth. </p> <br>

    <p> Most photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. 
        However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis; photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide,
        as a source of carbon. In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. <b> Oxygenic Photosynthesis </b> is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. <br><br>

        Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. 
        Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration: while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates, 
        cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrates or other nutrients to carbon dioxide.</p> <br>

    <h3> Oxygenic Photosynthesis </h3>
    <h3> Carbon Dioxode + Water + Solar Energy → Glucose + Oxygen <br> 
         6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2 </h3>
